So, how do you Seo?

Well, in order to obtain great stats with you Seo, you have to:

1. Research content

2. Respect Seo rules

3. Place a lot of Redirrects

4. Update and Upgrade


1. Research Content

⇢ Did you know that only 1/10 people go past the 1st page of the search results? Well, that is a fact.

In order to get on the 1st page, you have to find yourself a nieche. Search online until you find a query for which not much related content is shown.

Info - The query is what you have searched for, the search phrase
Then, get that query and place it as the title of your blogpost / content you are making. The title tag is the most definitive tag on the webpage.

Also, make sure that you only have 1 h1 tag on a webpage, with the same name as the title.


2. Respect Seo rules

Now, I will give you my Seo rules that I think sum up what you have to know to get the stats you want.
 


Seo Rules:

So, you have to:
